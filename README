List of files
==================

setup_env.sh This file is used to setup the environment to compile and run MPI and
             OpenMP programs on Eos. Make sure you execute the following command
             from your current shell
             $ source <path to setup_env.sh> setup_env.sh
             before you try to compile/run. A good practice is to place the above
             line in your ~/.bashrc

ulmann.h: head file for all functions used by main, including recursive ullman algorithm, prune algorithm, marix computation and so on.

ulmann.cpp: implementation of functions defined in ulmann.h.

ulmann_seq.cpp: main function to implement the sequential algorithm.

Makefile: File for compilation of the code files and clean up of the executables.

Set readfile directory
==================
ulmann_seq.cpp: set "graphsdb/si" to be the correct directory where the graphsdb locate, or copy one 'graphsdb' to current directory.

ss << "graphsdb/si" << pvalue << "/rand/r" << rvalue <<"/si" << pvalue << "_r" << rvalue << "_s" << bvalue << ".A" << gvalue;
Compiling on Eos
==================
$ make


This will generate 1 executable ulmann_seq.

Running Interactively on Eos
============================
Run the following command:
./ulmann_seq -p 2 -b 20 -r 001 -g 00
./ulmann_seq -p 2 -b 20 -r 005 -g 01

p b r g are parameters to read graph file.

p: the persentage of small graph size of the big graph size, here we use 2 4 6 doneting 20% 40% 60%.

b: big graph node number, for Sequential Ullman algorithm we can use 20 and 40, for Ulmann algorithm with distance, we can use [20 40 60 80 100].

r: the probability of two nodes connect with each other in big graph, here we use 001, 005, 01 denoting the probabilities are 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 respectively.

g: the 00th graph, range is [00-99]


Submit files to eos using bash command
============================
The bash file is in directory /seq_bash

Submit a single file:
qsub seq_1cpu_8_20_01.job

submit two files 32 times:
source submit_helper.sh
